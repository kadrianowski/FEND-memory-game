## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).


## Features

The game uses a simple matching logic, which enables to toggle on at most 2 cards and compare their values. Each move (each pair comparing) is counted and displayed. There's also a 3-star rating system to showcase 
player's score. After the game is completed, modal pops up and presents the player with the time it took to finish, number of moves and corresponding star score. From there, the game can be replayed from the scratch.


## Special thanks

This wouldn't be possible without StackOverflow, great people of internet and Headspace meditation app.

## Getting started

* Open the `index.html` file in your browser or open it with your favorite editor.

* Have fun! 

## How does it work?

* The deck contains eight pairs of matching symbols.
* Click a card to reveal its icon.  
* Click another card to see if they are the same.
* If two cards selected in consecutive order are a match, they will stay open.
* After you uncover them all, a modal will pop up and show you how well you finished the game. 
* Click replay button or restart icon if you want to improve your score.

## Features

* The game uses a simple matching logic, which enables to toggle on at most 2 cards and compare their values. 
* Each move (each pair comparing) is counted and displayed. 
* There's also a 3-star rating system to showcase 
player's score. 
* After the game is completed, modal pops up and presents the player with the time it took to finish, number of moves and corresponding star score. From there, the game can be replayed from the scratch.
